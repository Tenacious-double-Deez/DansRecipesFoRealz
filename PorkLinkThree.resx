    <value>BROWN BUTTER–BASTED PORK CHOP

1” thick pork chop (4)
 Salt, ground pepper
2 tsp. vegetable oil
3 Tbsp. unsalted butter
2 sprigs rosemary
2 garlic cloves, crushed
Flaky sea salt

Season chops with kosher salt and pepper and let sit at room temperature 1 hour.Heat a dry large skillet, over medium-high, then add oil. 
As soon as oil is smoking, cook chops, turning every 2 minutes or so, until a deep brown crust forms.

Add butter, rosemary, and garlic to skillet, tilt pan toward you so that butter pools on one side and use a large spoon to continually baste steak with butter. 
Continue until butter is no longer bubbling and it smells nutty and is beginning to brown, about 1 minute. Transfer meat to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.

    <value>SLOW COOK ROOT BEER PULLED PORK

5 pounds boneless pork shoulder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 (12-ounce) bottle or can root beer
1 (16-ounce) jar barbecue sauce

Season the shoulder on all sides with the salt and place in a 6-quart or larger slow cooker, Pour the root beer over the pork. 
Cover and cook on the LOW setting until the pork is tender and shreds easily with tongs, 8 to 10 hours. 
The juices and fat from the pork will render, creating liquid around the pork.

Transfer the pork to a clean cutting board or large bowl. Shred with 2 forks. Return the shredded pork to the slow cooker. 
Add the barbecue sauce and stir to coat the pork. Reduce the heat to the LOW or WARM setting for serving.

    <value>4-INGREDIENT BAKED PORK CHOPS

You only need 4 ingredients and about 5 minutes to prepare these Baked Pork Chops

4 thick-cut boneless pork chops
Italian salad dressing
Dijon mustard
Brown Sugar

To start, pat the pork dry with a paper towel and season with salt and pepper. 

Place the chops in a large baking dish. Whisk together the Italian dressing, mustard, and brown sugar to form the most delicious sweet-and-savory sauce. 
Pour the marinade over the pork chops.

Now bake the pork chops (uncovered) at 400 degrees F for about 20 minutes.
